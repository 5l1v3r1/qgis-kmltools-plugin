# QGIS Simple KML Importer Plugin

This is a very simple QGIS KML/KMZ importer plugin. It reads all KML points into one QGIS table irregardless of what folder they are in. The same is true for lines. It ignores styling information so basically it is importing only raw geometery. It retains the object names and description as well as nested folders the object was in.
