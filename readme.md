# QGIS Simple KML Importer Plugin

The native QGIS importer creates separate layers for each folder within a KML. If there are hundreds of layers, the import can be very slow or can crash QGIS and creates an undesirable number of layers. This plugin only creates one point layer, one line layer, and one polygon layer. It adds the nested folder structure to a field in the QGIS layer. This makes the KML/KMZ import very quick. You can use the 'folders' field to sort and filter on what was previously folders in the KML. It ignores the KML style information and parses the feature name, description, altitude for point layers, and time information.
